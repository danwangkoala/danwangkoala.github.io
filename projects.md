Most of my projects have been in the area of  Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. 

Ongoing project (Master's Thesis)
----------------
+ [Do-It-Yourself (D.I.Y.) Smart Home](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/research/diysmarthome/index.php)
	+ Develop care-giver user interface for customized domain knowledge building. 
	+ Considering uncertainty, propose hierarchical activities tracking algorithm using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Bayesian Networks (BN).

Previous Project
----------------


+ [Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones](https://danwangkoala.github.io/activity_recog.pdf)
	+ Implemented three classifiers for activities recognition: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Support Vector machine (SVM), and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). 
	+ Trained and tested the classifiers on the [UCI HAI dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and obtained very good performance. 
	+ **Skills**: MATLAB, machine learning

+ [BBM Protected and PetalMD Integration for Physician Schedule Status Exchange (January 2016 to April 2016)](https://github.com/danwangkoala/BBM-protected-and-PetalMD-Integration)
	+ Realize physician schedule status secure exchange between the BBM protected and the PetalMD with the help of Mirth Connect integration engine.
	+ Develop a simulated PetalMD with basic server and client function; Provide API for the Mirth Connect for information exchange; channel design in Mirth Connect for PetalMD and Mirth Communication. 
	+ **Skills**: Full-stack web development, AngularJS, JavaScript, Mirth Connect

+ [Gesture Recognition for Adding Sound Effects (September to December 2015)](https://danwangkoala.github.io/Gesture_recog.pdf)
	+ Generate real-time sound effects for on-going gestures did in front of a Kinect.
	+ Implement gesture recognition algorithm (DTW based KNN); design a sound effect triggering strategy considering the gesture duration. 
	+ **Skills**: Machine learning, Dynamic programming, Kinect for Windows (SDK) 1.0

+ [Earthquake Detection in Tweets using Apache Storm, November 2014](https://github.com/danwangkoala/Earthquake-detection-in-Tweets)
	+ Report "earthquake happened" when relevant tweets ration reach a threshold. 
	+ Design a topology with one spout and two bolts. Implement a SVM based bolt to classifier the split tweets from the split bolt.
	+ **Skills**: Machine learning, Apache Storm, Java

+ [Emergency Response Task Automated Planning, Research Assistant, September 2012 to June 2015](https://github.com/danwangkoala/HTN-planning-for-emergency-response)
	+ Build a comprehensive emergency collaborate response network with multiple hierarchical organizations using snow-ball process.
	+ Proposed network analysing method to obtain key tasks & relations and shared resources of many departments.
	+ Proposed a faster algorithm for emergency response plan generating with time & resource constraints.
	+ **Skills**: Java, C++, LISP, MySQL, MATLAB, Hierarchical Task Network Planning.
