Most of my projects have been in the area of  Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. 

Ongoing project (Master's Thesis)
----------------
+ [Do-It-Yourself (D.I.Y.) Smart Home](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/research/diysmarthome/index.php)
	+ Develop care-giver user interface for customized domain knowledge building. 
	+ Considering uncertainty, propose hierarchical activities tracking algorithm using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Bayesian Networks (BN).  

Previous Project
----------------

+ [Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones](danwangkoala.github.io/activity_recog.pdf)
	+ Implemented three classifiers for activities recognition: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Support Vector machine (SVM), and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). 
	+ Trained and tested the classifiers on the [UCI HAI dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and obtained very good performance.
