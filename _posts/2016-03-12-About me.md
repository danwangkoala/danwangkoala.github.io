I am a Master's Student in the Computer Science Department at University of Waterloo. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Graph based Semi Supervised Learning and Deep Learning.  Before starting my Master's I worked as a Data Scientist at McGraw Hill Financial. My work there was mostly on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrival.
