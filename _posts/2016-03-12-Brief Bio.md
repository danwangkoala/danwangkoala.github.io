I am a Master's Student in the Computer Science Department at University of Waterloo. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Graph based Semi Supervised Learning and Deep Learning.  I work with [Professor Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/). Before starting my Master's I worked as a Data Scientist at McGraw Hill Financial. My work there was mostly on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrival.
