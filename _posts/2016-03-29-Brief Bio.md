I am a Master's Student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and reasoning with uncertainty. My thesis topic is goal recognition with uncertainty. The application field is smart home. The aim is to design and develop intelligent assistance system to guide people with memory impairment or brain injury in daily tasks. The goal tracking and reasoning engine is based on hierarchical task recognition with uncertainty. I work with [Professor Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/).

I got a **master's** degree in Systems Engineering and a bachelor's degree in Logistics Engineering from the [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). My thesis topic for the master degree is automated planning and its application to emergency response task planning with temporal constraints.
