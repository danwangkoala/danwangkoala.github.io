I am a Master's Student in the Computer Science Department at University of Waterloo. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Graph based Semi Supervised Learning and Deep Learning.  I work with [Professor Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/). 
I graduated from BITS Pilani , Goa Campus in 2014 after which I briefly worked as a Data Scientist at [McGraw Hill Financial](https://www.spcapitaliq.com/). My work there was mostly on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrival.
